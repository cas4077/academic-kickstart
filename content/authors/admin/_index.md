Clara  Stafford is a graduate trainee in the Brain and Mind Institute at Western University, under the supervision of [Dr. Adrian Owen](https://owenlab.uwo.ca/). Her research interests include traumatic brain injuries and understanding the long-term biopsychosocial impacts related to concussion. She is currently undertaking her 3rd year in her PhD program.

Clara completed her undergraduate thesis in 2015, under the supervision of Dr. Michael Petrides at the world-renowned Montreal Neurological Institute. She subsequently joined Dr. Owen's lab as a research assistant before beginning her graduate studies at Western University. Her Master's thesis investigated the structural neural correlates of cognitive-motor dissociation in patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness. She began her PhD in September 2017, and switched her research focus to understanding the long-term impacts of concussion in the general population.
